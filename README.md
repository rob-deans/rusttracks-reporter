# rusttracks-reporter

*It's not written in Rust if I don't mention it*

A project to replicate https://github.com/owntracks/recorder but of course in Rust :)

This is an experiment for myself to learn something and have something useful for me.

Currently utilising MQTT and SQLite.

## Feature map
- [ ] Record all MQTT messages to SQLite
- [ ] Set up API backend
- [ ] Set up frontend to plot locations on map
